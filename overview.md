Goals:

Enhanced Online Presence: Provide a professional and inviting digital storefront.

Information Hub: Centralize access to sermons, events, ministries, and contact information.

Community Engagement: Facilitate connection for members and visitors.

Streamlined Administration: Empower church staff to easily manage website content.

Global Reach: Serve members and potential members both locally and internationally.

Target Audience:

Current church members (local and dispersed).

Prospective members and visitors.

Individuals seeking spiritual content (sermons, teachings).

Those interested in church events and community initiatives.

2. Functional Requirements
The website will offer the following key functionalities:

Home Page:

Dynamic hero section (e.g., rotating banners, video backgrounds).

Highlights of upcoming events.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interfaces for:

Sermons.

Events.

Ministries.

Leadership Profiles.

Basic site settings (e.g., welcome message, social links).

Dashboard overview showing recent activity (e.g., recently added sermons, upcoming events).

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Fast loading times (target < 2-3 seconds on average connections).

Optimized images and media.

Efficient database queries.

Leverage browser caching for static assets.

Security:

HTTPS enforced (PythonAnywhere handles this).

Robust user authentication for admin (strong passwords, potential 2FA).

CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection (Django's built-in features).

Regular security updates for Django and dependencies.

Usability & User Experience (UX):

Intuitive navigation and clear information hierarchy.

Consistent design language across all pages.

Clear calls to action.

Error handling with user-friendly messages.

Responsiveness (Mobile-First):

Website must be fully responsive and optimized for seamless viewing and interaction on all devices (mobile phones, tablets, desktops) and screen orientations.

Content and navigation should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

Maintainability:

Modular Django app structure.

Clean, well-commented code.

Adherence to Django and Python best practices (PEP 8).

Scalability:

Designed to handle increasing content and user traffic.

Database schema designed for future expansion.

Accessibility (WCAG A/AA):

Basic accessibility considerations (e.g., semantic HTML, adequate color contrast, keyboard navigation support, alt text for images).

Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Tested on major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

4. Technical Stack
Backend Framework: Python 3.x, Django (latest stable version, e.g., 4.2 or 5.0).

Database:

Development: SQLite3 (for ease of local setup).

Production: PostgreSQL or MySQL (recommended for robustness and scalability on PythonAnywhere).

Frontend Technologies:

HTML5: Semantic markup.

CSS3: Styling, primarily using Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design.

JavaScript: Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, potentially a lightweight library like Alpine.js if complex dynamic behavior is needed beyond what Tailwind offers.

Deployment: PythonAnywhere (or similar cloud hosting like Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS EC2).

Key Django Libraries:

django-environ: For managing environment variables (.env files).

whitenoise: For efficient serving of static files in production.

django.contrib.sitemaps: For SEO.

Pillow: For image processing (if image uploads are handled directly).

django-crispy-forms or django-widget-tweaks: For styling forms.

5. Architecture (Django Apps Structure)
The project will be organized into logical Django applications to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

7. UI/UX Design Principles
The website will embody a modern, inviting, and user-centric design.

Mobile-First Design:

All layouts, typography, and interactive elements will be designed and implemented first for mobile devices, then progressively enhanced for larger screens.

Flexible grids and fluid images will ensure content adapts seamlessly.

Touch-friendly navigation and large tap targets.

Aesthetic & Visuals (Ultra Modern):

Clean Layouts: Ample whitespace to reduce clutter and improve readability.

Modern Typography:

Headings: A strong, clear sans-serif (e.g., Poppins or Montserrat).

Body Text: A highly readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Lato).

Color Palette (Professional & Inviting):

Primary Accent: #0EC6EB (Vibrant Teal/Cyan) - For interactive elements, primary buttons, active states, and subtle highlights.

Secondary Accent: #EB750E (Warm Orange) - For calls to action, secondary buttons, and complementary highlights.

Neutrals:

Backgrounds: #F8F8F8 (Soft Off-White) or pure #FFFFFF for clean sections.

Text: #333333 (Dark Charcoal) for main text, #666666 for secondary text.

Borders/Dividers: #EEEEEE

This palette provides a professional yet energetic and approachable feel.

Imagery: High-quality, authentic, and inspiring photos of the church community, activities, and relevant spiritual themes. Images will be optimized for web performance.

Subtle Animations: Smooth transitions for navigation, hover effects, and content loading to enhance user experience without being distracting.

7.3. Detailed Navigation Structure (Ultra-Modern, Clean UI)
The website's navigation will be meticulously designed for clarity and ease of use, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

Desktop Navigation:

A prominent, clean header with clear, concise labels for primary navigation items.

Dropdown menus or hover-activated sub-navigation will be used for sections with multiple sub-pages.

"Give" and "Member Portal" will be distinct, visually appealing buttons or prominent links in the header.

Mobile Navigation (Simplicity & Clarity):

A single, easily identifiable "hamburger" menu icon (e.g., ☰) will be used in the header.

Tapping the hamburger icon will reveal a full-screen or slide-out menu.

Within the mobile menu, primary navigation items will be listed.

Clicking a primary item that has sub-pages will expand an accordion-style list of its sub-navigation links, keeping the interface clean and uncluttered.

"Give" and "Member Portal" will be clearly visible and accessible as prominent buttons or distinct links within the mobile menu.

Main Navigation Structure:

Home

Implement secure login for administrators.

Deployment & Testing:

Prepare for production deployment (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL setup, environment variables on PythonAnywhere).

Set up Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools (sitemap submission, verification).

This comprehensive plan should provide your developers with a clear and actionable guide to build your modern church website.
